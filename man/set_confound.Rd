\usage{
set_confound(model, confound = NULL, add_confounds_df = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A \code{causal_model}. A model object generated by \code{\link{make_model}}.}

\item{confound}{A named \code{list}. It relates nodes to statements that identify causal types with which they are confounded}

\item{add_confounds_df}{Logical. Attach a dataframe with confound links. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{causal_model}. It essentially returns a list containing the elements comprising
a model (e.g. 'statement', 'nodal_types' and 'DAG') with the parameter matrix updated according to `confound`.
}
\description{
Adjust parameter matrix to allow confounding.

\details{
Confounding between X and Y arises when the nodal types for X and Y are not independently distributed. In the X -> Y graph, for instance, there are 2 nodal types for X and 4 for Y. There are thus 8 joint nodal types:
\preformatted{
|          | t^X                |                    |           |
|-----|----|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
|     |    | 0                  | 1                  | Sum       |
|-----|----|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| t^Y | 00 | Pr(t^X=0 & t^Y=00) | Pr(t^X=1 & t^Y=00) | Pr(t^Y=00)|
|     | 10 | .                  | .                  | .         |
|     | 01 | .                  | .                  | .         |
|     | 11 | .                  | .                  | .         |
|-----|----|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
|     |Sum | Pr(t^X=0)          | Pr(t^X=1)          | 1         |
}

This table has 8 interior elements and so an unconstrained joint distribution would have 7 degrees of freedom.
A no confounding assumption means that Pr(t^X | t^Y) = Pr(t^X), or  Pr(t^X, t^Y) = Pr(t^X)Pr(t^Y). In this case there would be 3 degrees of freedom for Y and 1 for X, totalling 4 rather than 7.

\code{set_confounds} lets you relax this assumption by increasing the number of parameters characterizing the joint distribution. Using the fact that P(A,B) = P(A)P(B|A) new parameters are introduced to capture P(B|A=a) rather than simply P(B).

The simplest way to allow for confounding is by adding a bidirected edge, such as via: \code{set_confound(model, list('X <-> Y'))}.
In this case the descendent node has a distribution conditional on the value of the ancestor node.

Ordering of conditioning can also be controlled however via  \code{set_confound(model, list(X = 'Y'))}
in which case \code{X} is given a distribution conditional on nodal types of \code{Y}.

More specific confounding statements are also possible using causal syntax.
A statement of the form \code{list(X = 'Y[X=1]==1')} can be interpreted as:
'Allow \code{X} to have a distinct conditional distribution when \code{Y} has types that involve Y[X=1]==1.'
In this case nodal types for \code{Y} would continue to have 3 degrees of freedom.
But there would be parameters assigning the probability of X when t^Y = 01 or t^Y=11 and
other parameters for residual cases. Thus 6 degrees of freedom in all. This is still short of
an unconstrained distribution, though an  unconstrained distribution can be achieved with
repeated application of statements of this form, for instance via
\code{list(X = 'Y[X=1]>Y[X=0]'), X = 'Y[X=1]==Y[X=0]')}.

Similarly a statement of the form \code{list(Y = 'X==1')} can be interpreted as:
'Allow Y to have a distinct conditional distribution when X=1.' In this case there would be
two distributions over nodal types for Y, producing 2*3 = 6 degrees of freedom.
Nodal types for X would continue to have 1 degree of freedom.
Thus 7 degrees of freedom in all, corresponding to a fully unconstrained joint distribution.
